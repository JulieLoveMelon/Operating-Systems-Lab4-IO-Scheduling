This repository includes four files, iosched.cpp, lab4-iosched-fall2018.pdf, Makefile and README.txt.
The pdf is the requirements for the lab from the instructer of the course. 
iosched.cpp is the main file which contains the source code satisfying the demands in the pdf.
Makefile organizes code compilation for the Linux system. 
In the lab, I implemented different scheduling algorithms of IO operations including FIFO, SSTF, LOOK, CLOOK and FLOOK. Output tells the arriving time, start time and end time of each IO request. Some basic information of the whole system is also included, such as the total simulated time, total number of tracks the head had to be moved and maximum waiting time for any IO operation.
